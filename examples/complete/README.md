# Complete tenant example with Application Profiles, EPGs, Bridge Domains, VRF and Static path mapping
To run this example you need to execute:
```bash
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
Note that this example will create resources. Resources can be destroyed with `terraform destroy`.
```hcl
